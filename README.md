# Geocoding-Addresses-in-R
Example of a R scrpit to geocode addresses using tidygeocoder

In this repository, I added a R script (Geocoding address with Tidygeocoder.R), an input dataset (Hosp_CEPs_with_address.xlsx), and an output dataset (Hosp_CEPs_with_address_and_coord_tidygeocoder.xlsx). This example may help people to understand how the tidygeocoder library works. This example uses Brazilian addresses.

The syntax of this library is quite simple. In it, you can use various 'geocoding services' such as Google or Bing, but these require a key. I use arcGIS because it is free and provides very satisfactory results, as you can see in the output dataset.

Hope this can help someone
